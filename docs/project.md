# Project

**GAMEX (Generative AI Modeling for Extreme Events: Statistical Foundations)** is a Una Europa seed-funded initiative (Jan–Dec 2026) building an international research community at the interface of **Generative AI** and **Extreme Value Theory (EVT)**.

## Motivation
Extreme events (e.g., floods, heatwaves, financial tail risk) are increasingly relevant for decision-making. While modern generative models scale to high-dimensional data, they often struggle to reproduce tail behaviour reliably. GAMEX connects the scalability of Generative AI with the rigor and interpretability of EVT to foster robust modeling of rare, high-impact events.

## Objectives
- **Scientific advancement:** strengthen collaboration on methods that integrate Generative AI and EVT for modeling extremes.
- **Community building and training:** support early-career researchers through seminars, events, and short-term visits.
- **Strategic development:** expand the network with additional academic and industrial partners and lay foundations for future funding initiatives (e.g., MSCA Staff Exchange, Doctoral Networks).
