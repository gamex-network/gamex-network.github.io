# GAMEX  

**Generative AI Modeling for Extreme Events: Statistical Foundations**, or simply **GAMEX**, is a [**Una Europa seed-funded initiative (2026)**](https://www.una-europa.eu/opportunities/seed-funding) that brings together researchers in statistics, machine learning, artificial intelligence and data science to build an international research network at the interface of **Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Extreme Value Theory (EVT)**, with the aim of developing reliable, interpretable, and scalable methods for modeling rare, high-impact events.
