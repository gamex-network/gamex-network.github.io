# GAMEX  
## Generative AI Modeling for Extreme Events

**GAMEX (Generative AI Modeling for Extreme Events: Statistical Foundations)** is a **Una Europa seed-funded initiative (2026)** building an international research network at the intersection of **Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Extreme Value Theory (EVT)**.

The project brings together researchers in statistics, machine learning, and data science to advance reliable and interpretable methods for modeling **rare, high-impact events**, with applications ranging from climate risk to finance and environmental sciences.

## Why GAMEX

Extreme events such as floods, heatwaves, and financial crises are increasingly central to scientific analysis and decision-making. While modern generative models scale efficiently to complex, high-dimensional data, they often fail to reproduce tail behaviour and extreme dependence structures.

GAMEX addresses this gap by fostering collaboration between experts in EVT and Generative AI, with the goal of developing models that are both scalable and theoretically grounded.

## Key activities in 2026

- **Scientific Workshop**  
  *University of Bologna, 11–12 June 2026*

- **Summer School on Generative AI for Extremes**  
  *University of Edinburgh, 8–11 September 2026*

- **Online Seminar Series**  
  Regular talks by GAMEX partners and invited external speakers

- **Short-term Research Visits**  
  Mobility opportunities for PhD students and early-career researchers (ECRs)

## A platform for long-term collaboration

GAMEX is conceived as a **platform**, not a stand-alone project. Beyond its 2026 activities, the network aims to support future collaborative initiatives and to expand through additional academic and industrial partnerships.
