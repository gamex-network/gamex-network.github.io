# GAMEX  
## Generative AI Modeling for Extreme Events

**GAMEX (Generative AI Modeling for Extreme Events: Statistical Foundations)** is a **Una Europa seed-funded initiative (2026)** building an international research network at the intersection of **Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Extreme Value Theory (EVT)**.

The project brings together researchers in statistics, machine learning, and data science to advance reliable and interpretable methods for modeling **rare, high-impact events**, with applications ranging from climate risk to finance and environmental sciences.
